            <p>Link to video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeDP-rzOnAA">here</a></p>
            <hr class="my-3">
            <div>
                <p>In the video “Build A Responsive Website With HTML & CSS Tutorial” by user Dev Ed, we are taken along to build a simple yet stylish website using HTML and CSS only. With no Bootstrap to make this website, one gains an understanding of positioning elements and make a simple, but stylish website.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In the video, there were many cool ideas introduced to me as a web designer. One is the using the linear gradient and adjusting the CSS to make it so that the text is transparent and the linear color gradient to fill in the color of the text. While he didn’t use it too excessively, it was a subtle design trick that one can easily implement into their code. Another design choice this video shows is with the big circles faded circles in the background of the website. The way he knows how to position them almost instinctively is very impressive. Positioning them so they do not overlap. In addition to that, there is also the changes made for mobile screen size such as changing the flex-direction attribute to column to change the positioning of circle images. Because mobile and desktop windows are so different, the layout must be changed, and Dev Ed knows this and shows us how to change it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now some of the negatives of this are that the tutorial can be a little long, and that while it is in depth, some of it can be done simpler by using bootstrap. Which except for the more unique design aspects, could take care of the general positioning instead of making our own CSS file. Example would be for the header with the three dots logo, links, and the shopping cart logo, which could’ve been done in Bootstrap with a div container. Though compared to these nitpicks, for a simple tutorial of HTML and CSS that produces a rather stylish webpage, it does it’s job well. That concludes my review of this web-design tutorial.</p>

            <h2 id="ArticleText">Article Review: 3 common usability issues</h2>
            <p id="regText">Link to article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/9-common-usability-blunders/">here</a></p>
            <hr class="my-3">
            <div>
                <p>Usability issues are a common problem that web designers must face. Web design is all about the user experience, to make a satisfying experience and not a frustrating one for the user. After reading an article which talks, I will discuss what I personally are  three of the worst mistakes made in web development.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>First off is tiny clickable areas, which having experienced, is one of the most frustrating design mishaps to have to deal with on my phone or desktop. For example, sometimes on youtube, you will be watching a video and all of a sudden a pop up ad comes up with a very small cancel button. Then when you try to click the exit button, you click just outside it and then you get brought to a website which you don’t want to go to. As for buttons that are part of your website, making them small not only can be frustrating trying to click them but also hard to see them which can just confuse the user and make them dislike a developers app even more. Another aspect is no way for the users to communicate with developers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nobody makes a perfect app, that's why feedback is important along with many other reasons. Putting links to ones email or phone number, so users can submit feedback to the web designer. While this does raise the concern of spam emails, there are workarounds that can solve this issue. Online forums are also a great solution, because in addition to it putting the developers and users in contact with each other, it puts other users in contact with one another so there are more resources to solve issues with the web-based app and the users can help one another as well. So speaking of no war to contact the developers, what about searching?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>When one goes to a website and there is so much data to go through, but you know exactly what you want, naturally narrowing it down with a search would make it simple right? Almost any site you visit will have a search function which users who know what they want and do not want to deal with the navigation of the website. The article refers to these kinds of users are called “search-dominant” users who according to a study make up more than half of users. Which makes sense considering sites like Amazon, Google, any shopping website, most blogs, and so many more have the feature in their websites. The great thing about this is that one usually one doesn’t have to hard code the search function into their website to make it easier. And with that, we have covered three big usability issues in web design.
                </p>
                <p>Usability is one of the biggest priorities when it comes to web development, because if your users don’t like your app, then they will get rid of it and find another one. These three however are in my opinion the most annoying as a user. So remember to have decently sized clickable areas, a forum or something users can use to contact you, and a search function in your website. Having these will help a website be much more appealing to users.

            <h2 id="ArticleText">Article Review: 10 tips to improve Usability</h2>
            <p>Link to article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/10/30-usability-issues-to-be-aware-of/">here</a></p>
            <hr class="my-3">
            <div>
                <p>In this piece I will discuss 10 usability issues for developers to keep in mind when building applications. Some of these range from rules, to basic advice from a user standpoint to help improve your website.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In this section I am going to talk about the the laws of the Gestalt principles of form perception. The first being the law of proximity, which basically says that when we see objects that are close together, we associate them in a group. Take for example Netflix and how in the main menu it has shows grouped in rows, while we see the title that categorizes them, we can usually deduce that they are a group by how close they are together. The second law is the law of similarity which is the idea that elements will be grouped together. So if say there are sections in a website that have a similar shape, size, or color we naturally want to categorize them. Prägnanz law is about how some objects on a website pop out while others fade into the background. The law of symmetry is pretty self explanatory. And finally the law of closure which is that we will think objects are complete, or have all their components when they might not. Kind of like those optical illusions that one has to take a closer look to notice. All of these rules seem basic, but they lay the foundation for any good website and are the fundamentals of web design.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Next up are the 2-second-rule and the 3-click-rule usability principles. Two second rule is basically meant to be an approximate amount of time the user should have to wait for a response. It makes sense considering users these days want to go through the app as a fast as possible. Considering a single five second youtube ad or more than a two second delay for it to play is enough to get me slightly annoyed at the app. The two second rule may seem a little demanding, but considering it's basically a standard with todays applications, one should take it to heart. Now onto the three-click-rule. This has to do with navigation of a website. Basically it should take 3 clicks for the user to get to where they want. Which I view as more of a guideline rather than a rule. While it helps with helping to structure a website, sometimes it doesn’t work out. Say you want to look for a previous page in a blog and have to click next to get to a previous post. It's good to keep this in mind while building a website, but sometimes it cannot be avoided.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Lastly here are some final tips for your website, one being to not use pop ups for your website since it can disrupt the user session. This is something I can get behind, since ads popping up when I’m on youtube or other sites is just flat out annoying and doesn’t contribute anything to the user experience. Another is to not use small font sizes when styling your website. As a user I would rather text be bigger than smaller, since it's easier to read. You more often than not hear text being too small on a website then too big. And the last tip for usability to offer is too not have dead links, basically if you have links that don’t go anywhere, get rid of them. Usually when you are building the base for your website, some templates might have dead links in their structure, which at least is where I run into the issue. Otherwise thats it for me with tips and tricks for improving the usability of your website.

            <hr class="my-3">
            <div>
                <p>So in the previous articles we have talked about mistakes or things that you should avoid doing when programming. Now let's talk about things one can do to improve usability with an app. Without further wait, let's get into it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Availability and accessibility, which is all about can your users access your website and it works. If it doesn’t for whatever reason, then your website becomes worthless in the eyes of the user and whatever potential customers you could've had are gone. To avoid this, its important that the server or whatever is hosting the website has quality and dependable. Also do not have dead links in your website, it doesn’t matter if they don’t impact the website, because if one feature is broken, the user might assume the website is unreliable. Another good aspect is to approach designing an app with a mobile first approach, as it demands a quality experience for the user and that should translate over to desktop as well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Next up is clarity, as in keep your website simple and not filled to the brim with features on one page. It will distract users and ultimately detract from their experience. Also keep it familiar in a sense of looking at what other sites do instead of trying to be something completely different, humans are creatures of habit so no need to reinvent the wheel. That goes hand in hand with consistency too, along with things like guiding your user through what the website offers through intuitive structures and design. Speaking of intuitive, learnability is another aspect that one should consider. Show, don’t tell, your user on how to go through the website. Again stick to what people know, it allows them to navigate the website easier, and they will already feel comfortable if your website feels familiar.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Another aspect to keep in mind for usability is to be credible, as in be honest and accurate with the info on your site. Even an About us page can help build credibility and make you feel more real and human to your users. Also style helps too, if your company is professional, then the website better matches it, otherwise it comes off as sketchy or outdated. Which brings us to our final recommendation, be relevant. What is your target audience, are you keeping up with users expectations and desires? Ask these questions and be sure of their answers so you have a clear direction of how to go forward. It's not simple, but that's how good usability is attained, by going at it again and again, moving forward.
